        A brief explanation of how you optimized the program flow by using asynchronous code - with the help of Promises -
        We used fetch () and then () functions.
        The fetch () function returns Promises, and the then () function takes care of the flow of the program.

        Server side brief explanation: Your REST interface description (http request type, URL and its parameters)
